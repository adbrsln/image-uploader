# image-uploader
simple image uploader script that you can use to host your own image uploader repositories. 

## Problems
after some problems for uploading image to "microsoft teams" group because im a guest user in the teams, i decided to use any image uploader from the wwww. but then i figure, if i upload some sensitive material, then the image will be compromised or something. so what i did was, create a simple image uploader hosting sites just for my usage. well. here it is.
