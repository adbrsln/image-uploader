# image-uploader
simple image uploader script that you can use to host your own image uploader repositories. 

## Problems
after some problems for uploading image to "microsoft teams" group because im a guest user in the teams, i decided to use any image uploader from the wwww. but then i figure, if i upload some sensitive material, then the image will be compromised or something. so what i did was, create a simple image uploader hosting sites just for my usage. well. here it is. Simple and no fuss. 

## Features
- upload image to the current directory . duh~
- username and password protected uploading method to prevent spamming.

## Usage
- update the username and password in the `upload.php` file.
- upload all the scripts on your server or something. 
- walla~! good to go.
